# Task - From given set of data, needs to find out what customers are valuable customers for Sprocket Ply Ltd.
First they have given the data in CSV files, which contain number of datasets. It contain information about customers personal information, what product they have bought from last two years and where they work, industry and their background information. Data was about Bicycle shop and transcation pattern.
I started with exploration of data. Understanding of data and relationship between them, data types of data, how they are important to me to get the result, what I will need and all.
I deleted those rows and columns which are not important. I have used Python, Pandas and Jupyter.
Next step data modeling, I have used PowerBi for it. Realtionship between the datasets.
Everthing was ready to start with visualization. I have created couple of reports. 
Reports on Top 10 customers, find customers job industry, Who are frequent buyers, do they have car etc.
Last step was presentation, I have used Power Point. 
First slide, what points need to be cleared.
Second slide, why data matters
Third slide for data exploration and what I found out about data.
Fourth slide for data modeling, explained relationship in dataset.
Fifth slide for multiple data visualization. Used bar chart and table for visualization.
Finally I conclude that customers,customers from affluent and high net worth are valuable customers.If we subcategorise them then they are from manufacturing and finance job industry.
